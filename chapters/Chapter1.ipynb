Floats, or floating point numbers, will be addressed in depth in the following chapter. Also, you can stipulate the number of decimal places by using <b>.Nf</b> where <b>N</b> is the number of decimal places. A common currency format would be <b>.2f</b> which specifies two decimal places. The following is an idea of what our table might look like once we’ve taken a few nibbles out of our asparagus."
