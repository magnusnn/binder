    "A Python module is a file that has a **.py** extension. These can be used to implement a set of attributes\n",
    "(variables), methods (functions), and classes (types). You can include a module in another Python program simply by using the **import** statement followed by the module name. To import a module named **requests**, include **import requests** within your Python program. You can now access the methods within the requests module by calling **requests.method_name()** or attributes, sometimes called variables, by calling **time.attribute_name**. The following code listing is an example using the **get()** method from the **requests** module. "
